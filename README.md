<h1>🚀 Microservices Node.js Project</h1>
This is a beginner-friendly but powerful microservices-based backend architecture using Node.js, Redis, RabbitMQ, and Docker Compose. Each service is isolated and communicates asynchronously via a message queue (RabbitMQ), making it scalable, fault-tolerant, and real-world ready.

I built this project while learning core backend concepts and DevOps tools to simulate how modern distributed systems work.

📁 Microservices Overview

Each service runs independently and connects via RabbitMQ and Redis. Here's what’s inside:

api-gateway: Routes incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate microservices.

identity-service: Handles authentication and identity-related logic.

post-service: Manages post creation, editing, and deletion.

media-service: Handles image/video uploads and media-related operations.

search-service: Provides search functionality.

redis: Centralized cache store and used for queue retries.

rabbitmq: Acts as the communication backbone (message queue) between services.

📦 Cloning and Running Locally

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.

Create .env files for each service:
You’ll find sample .env.example files (if not, you can create them based on the variables in docker-compose.yml like REDIS_URL and RABBITMQ_URL).

Run the entire stack:

docker-compose up --build

Access the services:

API Gateway → http://localhost:3000

Redis → localhost:6379

RabbitMQ Dashboard → http://localhost:15672 (Default user/pass: guest / guest)

📬 Messaging & Queueing Logic

All services publish and consume events using RabbitMQ. Events are structured in a pub-sub pattern using topic queues. Redis is used for caching and retry mechanisms for failed message deliveries.

—

🧪 Health & Monitoring

RabbitMQ includes a management dashboard at http://localhost:15672.

Health checks for RabbitMQ are built into the docker-compose file to avoid silent failures.

🧰 Dev Tips

If you make changes in service code, run docker-compose build again.

To stop all containers: docker-compose down

Use Docker volumes to persist logs/data across reboots (not included in this setup).

Would you like me to generate .env.example templates or Swagger specs next?

Also let me know if you want a logo, GitHub social preview image, or auto-generated API docs page for this project.
